# Consensys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2020

Below are the projects and dapps I worked on as part of the 2020 cohort.


## Coding my own Blockchain from Scratch in Python3 - blockchain.py

- Implemented a simple Proof of Work algorithm similar to HashCash
- Deployec Python Flask to communicate with blockchain through http requests
- Deployed Postman to interact with blockchain (create new transaction, mine new block, return full blockchain)
- Implemented consensus algorithm by checking chains in other nodes and finding the longest valid chain


## Generating Ethereum Accounts in Javascript

- Learning public key cryptography and digital signatures.
- Generate a private key, derive public keys from the private key and determine the associated accounts.

## Using Geth (Go-Ethereum)

- Geth (Go-Ethereum) is a command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go.
- Geth is used to mine real ether, transfer funds between addresses, create contracts and send transactions, and explore block history.
- Learned my way around the geth javascript console ($ geth console)
- Created private blockchain with proof of work consensus mechanism (test-private-blockchain)

    ### genesis.json
    - config: defines settings for private blockchain
    - chainId: identifies blockchain
    - alloc: allows creation of addresses and fills account with ether upon initialization of blockchain - left empty in order to fill accounts by mining ether
    - difficulty: indicates how difficult to discover valid hash of block - defines mining target - calculated according to previous block difficulty and timestamp - difficulty indicates how many average calculations miner will have to complete to find block - value fluctuates to maintain target block generation time
    - extraData: optional 32 byte value to add information
    - gasLimit: sets chain-wide limit of gas expenditure per block
    - parentHash: keccak256 hash of parent block's header
    - timestamp: output of Unix time() function at block's creation - used in calculation of difficulty level - allows verification of order of blocks in the chain
    - created new account
    - mined private chain
    - sent transaction
    - checked balance

- Created private blockchain with proof of authority consensus mechanism (geth-poa)
    - used native geth proof-of-authority protocol clique
    - configured clique via puppeth for creating custom genesis blocks
    - used bootnode to act as a router/hub where all nodes pass information and receive information from this node
    - launched node1 with genesis block (node1 is a mining node)
    - launched node2 and node3 to interact with blockchain
    - sent transactions from nodes to each other

## Writing Smart Contracts

### Proof of Existence (proof-of-existence)

- used ganache-cli for development blockchain
- practice with truffle create, migrate, console
- three versions: one proof, array of proofs, mapping of proofs
- used infura to deploy to rinkeby testnet

### Multi-Signature Wallet (MultiSignatureWallet.sol)

- multisignature wallet: an account that requires some m-of-n quorum of approved private keys to approve a transaction before it is executed
- learned how to handle complex interactions between multiple users on one contract
- learned how to avoid loops and implement voting
- learned to assess possible attacks on contracts
- worked with modifiers, events/emit, indexed keywords
- used truffle develop to interact with contract

### Assignment: SimpleBank

- bank with getBalance, enroll, deposit, withdraw
- used mappings, events

### Assignment: SupplyChain

- simple supply chain with ForSale, Sold, Shipped, and Received
- used mappings, structs, enums, events, modifiers
